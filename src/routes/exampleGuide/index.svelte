	<h1>Example Guide</h1>
	<p>This is an example guide.</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		This PC is designed to deliver high performance on all of today's most popular games without
		being complicated to build or costing too much. It will run well at high settings on 1080p or
		higher when playing Valorant, Fortnite, Minecraft, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six Siege, Apex
		Legends, PUBG, and more.
	</p>
	<h2>Note on Pricing</h2>
	<p>
		Because of supply and demand issues, some components are likely marked up higher than usual.
		This guide usually targets the $1000-1100 range. Parts can be purchased at close to normal
		prices with vigilance and patience.
	</p>
	<h2>CPU</h2>
	<p>
		The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X provides some of the best bang for your buck. It offers 6 cores, 12
		threads, a base frequency of 3.7GHz, and a turbo frequency of 4.6GHz. For better cooling, we've
		included an ARCTIC Freezer 34 eSports DUO. If you'd prefer to consider a similar build using an
		Intel processor, be sure to check out our Great Intel Gaming Build Guide.
	</p>
	<h2>Motherboard</h2>
	<p>
		The ASUS TUF B450M-PLUS is a good choice for a budget PC. It's a mid-range motherboard with a
		good amount of power and cooling. It's also a good choice for a budget PC because it's designed
		to be easy to build.
	</p>
	<h2>RAM</h2>
	<p>
		The Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR4-2666 is a good choice for a budget PC. It's a good choice for a
		budget PC because it's designed to be easy to build.
	</p>
	<h2>GPU</h2>
	<p>
		The MSI GeForce GTX 1660 Ti is a good choice for a budget PC. It's a good choice for a budget PC
		because it's designed to be easy to build.
	</p>
	<h2>Storage</h2>
	<p>
		With Solid State Drives (SSDs) the PC will boot, open programs, and load games considerably
		faster than mechanical drives. Since storage needs may differ, adjust the capacity as needed. We
		recommend at least 500 GB of SSD storage. 1TB typically provides the most optimal storage
		capacity for the price. We're use parametric filters to incorporate an NVME SSD with at least
		960GB of space.
	</p>
	<h2>Power Supply</h2>
	<p>
		We're using a parametric selection of well-reviewed units, all of which are 80+ Bronze certified
		or above and can provide plenty of power for this build. Note that because there are issues with
		PSU availability right now, some non-modular PSUs have been added to the build to help you get
		the parts you need. These are still high quality PSUs.
